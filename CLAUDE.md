# ClaudeLab (cclab)

## What is this project?
cclab is a Claude Code plugin that teaches Claude Code itself through progressive,
validated exercises — directly inside Claude Code. Think of it as an interactive
tutorial system where each exercise has setup, instructions, validation, and hints.

## Tech Stack
- Claude Code plugin (skills + subagents + hooks)
- Markdown (SKILL.md files, exercise content, documentation)
- JSON (plugin.json manifest, metadata, settings)
- Shell scripts (hooks, validation commands)

## Commands
- `claude` — start Claude Code in the project
- `gh pr create` — create a pull request
- `gh issue list` — list open issues

## Development Rules
- Every exercise MUST have at least one validation test.
- Exercise IDs use the format: `cc-NNN` (e.g., cc-001, cc-002).
- Exercises are grouped into tracks: fundamentals, skills, workflows, advanced.
- Each exercise has: metadata, setup script, instructions (markdown), validation script, hints (progressive).
- When creating a new exercise, use the `/create-exercise` skill.
- When validating exercise logic, use the `/validate-exercise` skill.

## Development Pipeline
Use the phase-gated pipeline for feature development:
1. `/prd-create` → PRD document (review & approve)
2. `/curriculum-design` → Curriculum design document (review & approve)
3. `/task-planning` → Task list + individual task files (review & approve)
4. `/implement-task TASK-NNN` → Exercise content, validation, commit

IMPORTANT: NEVER auto-advance between pipeline phases.
Each phase produces a document. I review it. I approve it. Only then proceed.

## Architecture Decisions
- Exercises are self-contained: each exercise folder has everything needed to run it.
- Validation is programmatic (not LLM-based) where possible — deterministic checks beat vibes.
- The hint system is progressive: hint 1 is gentle, hint 2 is more specific, hint 3 nearly gives the answer.
- Plugin hooks into Claude Code's skill system for exercise delivery.

## PR & Review
- All PRs need at least one review pass.
- Use `gh pr create` via Claude Code for PR creation.
- PR descriptions must include: what changed, why, how to test.
